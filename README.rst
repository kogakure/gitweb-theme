Theme for gitweb
================

This is an alternative theme for `gitweb`_ (tested with git web interface version 1.7.12.3). It is *strongly* inspired by GitHub.

Fullsize screenshots available on `kogakure.github.com/gitweb-theme`_.

Installation
============

The installation of this stylesheet is very easy:

1. Clone the repository to a location of your choice ``git clone https://github.com/kogakure/gitweb-theme.git``
2. Run ``./setup -vi --install`` and your gitweb will be themed!

 - If you are on Ubuntu, then the script will default to gitweb's installation directory "/usr/share/gitweb/".
 - If this is not where gitweb is located, then pass the directory to the script with the --target or -t option.

3. Of course you can just copy them to the new location too.

If you see some missing things or errors, please create a ticket or fix it and send a pull request.

Optionally, you can enable syntax highlighting for your code. Install the highlight package with your package manager and add this line to /etc/gitweb.conf:

  $feature{'highlight'}{'default'} = [1];

You can enable Gravatar support with this line:

  $feature{'avatar'}{'default'} = ['gravatar'];

Setup Script
============

::

  Usage: ./setup [-v|-i] [-t <TARGET>|--target <TARGET>] [--install|--remove|--repair]  
  Or: ./setup [-V|-h|--version|--help]

  This script will create symlinks to your gitweb install for themeing.
  The default location is '/usr/share/gitweb' unless set via -t or --target. 

  OPTIONS:
  -v, --verbose       Verbose output
  -i, --interactive   Pauses for confirmation at each step
  -t, --target        Where to create the symlinks, gitweb installation path
  -h, --help          Shows this usage message
  -V, --version       Displays version information
  --install           Adds '.bak' to original files and creates symlinks to theme files
  --remove            Deletes themed symlinks and restores the original files.
  --repair            Removes all theme files, then reinstalls
