Theme for gitweb
================

This is an alternative theme for `gitweb`_ (tested with git web interface version 1.7.12.3). It is *strongly* inspired by GitHub.

Fullsize screenshots available on `kogakure.github.com/gitweb-theme`_.

Installation
============

The installation of this stylesheet is very easy:

Just clone the repository to a location of your choice, probably into the same directory where the base gitweb stylesheet is located (in Ubuntu, this is e.g. /usr/share/gitweb/). It's recommended to move away the existing files and then create symlinks to the new files. You can do this with the following few commands::

  cd <PUT YOUR LOCATION OF GITWEB HERE, could be /usr/share/gitweb/>
  mv gitweb.css gitweb_original.css
  mv gitweb.js gitweb_original.js
  mv git-logo.png git-logo_original.png
  mv git-favicon.png git-favicon_original.png
  git clone git://github.com/kogakure/gitweb-theme.git
  ln -s gitweb-theme/gitweb.css gitweb.css
  ln -s gitweb-theme/gitweb.js gitweb.js
  ln -s gitweb-theme/git-logo.png git-logo.png
  ln -s gitweb-theme/git-favicon.png git-favicon.png

Of course you can just copy them to the new location. If you see some missing things or errors, please create a ticket or fix it and send a pull request.

Optionally, you can enable syntax highlighting for your code. Install the highligh package with your package manager and add this line to /etc/gitweb.conf:

  $feature{'highlight'}{'default'} = [1];
